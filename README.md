## üöÄ Features

- Built using `create-expo-app` with Expo CLI  
- Cross-platform: works on **Android**, **iOS**, and **Web**  
- Hot reloading and easy mobile preview using **Expo Go**
- Modular file-based routing and scalable structure
- Customizable template for different types of software solutions

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

1. **Install project dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
2. **Run the development server
   
   ``` bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
